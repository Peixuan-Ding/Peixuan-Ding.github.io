Abstract:
In data-driven mechanical fault diagnosis, domain adaptation is used to solve the problem of different distribution of collected data under varying operating conditions. However, the assumption of consistent label space between source and target domains is difficult to satisfy due to the types of faults that occur under different operating conditions not being completely identical. To address the problem of label inconsistency in partial domain adaptation, we propose a feature separation weight rectified network (FS-WRN). Shared domain features are extracted by feature separation, and the source and target domain distributions are aligned using the rectified local maximum mean discrepancy. The source domain features are weight-rectified by capturing changes in the target domain distribution during training to minimize the effect of negative transfer due to private classes. Three public datasets are used, and the results show that FS-WRN has promising fault diagnosis performance under complex partial domain adaptation tasks.
